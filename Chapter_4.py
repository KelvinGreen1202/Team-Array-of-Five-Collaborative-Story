    print("The demon reassembled from his shattered pieces however he was not like how he was once before.")
    print("The pieces slowly grew three times larger and took the resemblance of armor now.")
    print("These pieces slowly came together, rebuilding the demons body from his feet to his head")
    print("At the end of the rebuild the demon stood tall at about 18 feet in height.")
    print("He also had this thick coating of dark red titanium armor with a massive halberd in his hands")

    print("The demon spoke in a clear deep voice to Ivy and her allies")
    print("'I do not think you understand what you are dealing with.'")
    print("'I am no ordinary demon. I do not need an army like you weak humans'")
    print("Ivy responded saying 'You underestimate us and that will be your downfall'")
    print("Both Ivy and the demon stare at each other for a couple of seconds without saying anything")
    print("Neither side wants to make any move when all of a sudden they both charge in")
